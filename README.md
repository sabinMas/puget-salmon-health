Puget Sound Chinook Salmon Population Health Dashboard

Overview

This interactive web-based dashboard visualizes the health and status of Chinook salmon populations across Puget Sound watersheds in Washington State. The project combines geospatial analysis, historical population data, and environmental monitoring to tell the broader story of salmon recovery challenges and opportunities throughout the Puget Sound basin.

Rather than focusing on a single river system, this dashboard provides a watershed-scale perspective—highlighting how interconnected river systems, estuaries, and marine conditions collectively influence salmon survival in the Pacific Northwest.

Purpose

Chinook salmon populations throughout Puget Sound are ESA-listed (threatened), with many runs experiencing long-term declines over the past several decades. This dashboard aims to:

Visualize population trends – Show historical spawning run counts across multiple watersheds and identify concerning patterns

Map critical habitat – Display spawning and rearing habitat zones relative to current environmental conditions

Identify barriers – Locate fish passage obstacles (dams, culverts, tide gates) that restrict habitat access

Highlight restoration opportunities – Show where conservation and infrastructure projects can have the greatest impact

Communicate environmental context – Connect salmon decline to measurable stressors such as warming water, habitat loss, altered stream flow, and ocean survival conditions

The dashboard is designed for educational use, environmental storytelling, and practical conservation planning—demonstrating how data visualization can support real-world salmon recovery decision-making across Puget Sound.
